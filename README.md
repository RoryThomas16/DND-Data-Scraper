<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a personal repo for me to practice with web-scraping. This isn't anything *Spectacular* and is just for me to say "hey, I understand how it works.
I basically look at a DND wiki to see if I can pull information about the spells for each class, and some rudimentary analysis is included.

### Built With
The code is predominantly built in Python; primarily Jupyter Notebooks.
The Notebook has been run with the following libraries:
* Python [= 3.11.11]
* requests
* BeautifulSoup
* Matplotlib
* collections
* nltk
